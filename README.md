Departmental Review: Departments with high exits (e.g., Accounting, Engineering) may need engagement surveys or leadership reviews.

Diversity Monitoring: Continue tracking gender distribution and exits to ensure equity.

Succession Planning: Use tenure and age data to identify upcoming retirements and prepare replacements.
